This Dockerfile will build you an image for running brewpi connecting to an arduino with a serial to wifi bridge, like an esp8266 running esp-link.

It expects the following environment to be passed in;
AVR=ip/host:port of serial wifi bridge, eg. AVR=192.168.1.1:23
TZ=your time zone, eg. TZ=Australia/Brisbane
